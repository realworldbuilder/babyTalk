                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How do I record a feeding or activity?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Simply tap the microphone button and speak naturally. Say something like "Fed Emma at 2am, bottle, 4 ounces, she finished it all." The AI will structure this into a proper log entry.</div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What if the app doesn't understand what I said?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">You can always edit the transcription or the structured entry before saving. The AI gets better over time, but we know baby talk (the parent kind) can be complicated!</div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Can I record without internet?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Yes! The app records your voice locally and processes it when you're back online. Perfect for those middle-of-the-night moments when WiFi is spotty.</div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Does it work in noisy environments?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">The app works best in quieter environments, but it can handle typical household noise. If baby is crying, you might want to wait for a quieter moment or speak a bit closer to your phone.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">How does the AI work?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">We use OpenAI's Whisper for speech-to-text transcription and GPT-4o to understand and structure your entries. The AI looks for key information like times, amounts, feeding types, and notes to create organized log entries.</div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What data is sent to AI services?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">We're completely transparent: Your audio recordings are sent to OpenAI's Whisper service for transcription, and the resulting text is sent to GPT-4o for structuring. No other data (like baby profiles or historical logs) leaves your device.</div>
                </div>

                    <div class="faq-question">Can the AI learn my baby's patterns?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">The AI provides insights based on your logged data, like "Emma typically feeds every 3 hours" or "Longest sleep stretch this week was 5 hours." All analysis happens locally on your device for privacy.</div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What if the AI structures something incorrectly?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">You can always edit entries before or after saving. The app learns from corrections to improve future suggestions.</div>

                    <div class="faq-answer">Yes, absolutely. Your baby's profile, historical logs, and patterns never leave your device. Only voice recordings and transcribed text are processed by AI services for the specific purpose of creating log entries.</div>

                    <div class="faq-answer">No. Voice recordings are temporarily sent to OpenAI for transcription, then deleted. We don't store audio files anywhere.</div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">

                    <div class="faq-answer">Since most data is stored locally on your device, you can delete entries or clear all data anytime from the app settings. Deleting the app removes all local data.</div>
                </div>
